# PROJECT NAME: Salary Calculator

## Description

_Duration: ~ 7hrs (Friday, Sat afternoon, Majority of time spent trying to figure out stretch goals. ) _


This project has created a salary calculator that allows you to input information into the input fields and submit that data into an organized table. At the bottom of the table a calculated total will appear of the total monthly cost of employing all of these workers with their given salaries. If the monthly cost exceeds $20,000 and red warning will appear to alert you. You may also delete employees from the table but their salaries will still be factored into the monthly cost.
